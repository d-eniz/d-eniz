# Hi, I'm Deniz ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a biomedical engineering student at UCL with a strong foundation in software engineering, human-machine interfaces, and predictive analytics. I specialize in integrating data science and machine learning into healthcare solutions to drive real-world impact. Previously, I served as president of the UCL Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Society, where I fostered collaboration among emerging engineers.

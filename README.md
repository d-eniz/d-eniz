# Hi, I'm Deniz 👋

I’m a master's student in biomedical engineering at UCL with a passion for leveraging software engineering, human-machine interfaces, and predictive analytics to create transformative healthcare solutions. My work focuses on the integration of data science and machine learning into medical research to drive real-world impact.

🔍 **Current Projects**

- **Deep Learning for Medical Imaging:** Developing a semi-supervised deep learning model to segment anatomical regions of interest in T2-weighted MR images of the pelvis.
- **Web-Based ML Integration:** Enhancing my fullstack development skills to bring machine learning models to life as interactive web applications.
